1. indexes , types of indexes:
    Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster access to data. Postgresql offers various types of indexes
    A) B-tree indexes default index type on postgresql (suitable for equality and range queries)
    B) Hash Index optimized for equailty comparisions
    C) GIN Generalized inverted index (efficient for indexing array  , JSONB , and full text search)
    D) GIST Generalized Search Tree (Support complex data type like geometric shapes
    E) BRIN Block range Indexes
    F) SP-GIST
    G) PARTIAL index
    H) UNIQUE INDEX

2. pg_stat_statements
   A) enable the extension by this sql (CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements);
   B) shared_preload_libraries= 'pg_stat_statements';
   C) SELECT pg_reload_conf();
   D) For viewing top quereis (
   SELECT
       query,
       calls,
       total_time,
       rows
   FROM
       pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY
       total_time DESC
   LIMIT 10;

   )


3. Hash partitioning
    (Hash partitioning splits table data into multiple partitions based on a hash of a column's values. It is ideal for evenly distributing data that lacks a natural range split.)
